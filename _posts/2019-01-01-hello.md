My name is Raju. Currently, I am working as an Info Security Engineer with a Banking firm. I love taking challenging assignments. So this year I want to complete my OSCP certification. I started researching more about the certification and amused by the wealth of information available on the internet. I took notes of TODOs and almost, everyone echoed one statement, "Get organized".  So I wanted to have things organized and write my blog of findings so that I can have look at them in future.

I am a Computer Geek, with no writing skills. So, please bear with me.
