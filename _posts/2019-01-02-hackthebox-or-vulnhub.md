I read a lot about these two platforms and their importance in preparing for OSCP. But as a beginner, which one should I start with? Hackthebox or Vulnhub.

### Hackthebox
I am attracted to Hackthebox, as there is no lab setup involved and you will get ranked amongst the other participants.

I signed up for [Hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) and got my VPN access. Within no time, I fell in love with this website. There are 20 machines online and ready to be attacked. And also there are so many retired machines for which you can see walkthroughs by [ippsec on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA). I saw some ippsec videos and I felt like I am ready for testing my skills.

Problems I faced with Hackthebox:
* People reset the machines so often
* And people corrupt important files

### Vulnhub
Unlike Hackthebox, where you have everything ready for you to attack, [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) takes some time for you to download VMs and set up the lab. For beginners guide to Vulnhub, you can follow this [link](https://medium.com/@gavinloughridge/a-beginners-guide-to-vulnhub-part-1-52b06466635d).

### Conclusion
If you are a noobie, I will suggest starting with Vulnhub. Otherwise, both are fantastic platforms.
